**System Prompt Tutorial: Plugin Features, Multi-Turn Conversations, Custom System Prompts**

This tutorial primarily introduces the system prompts for plugin features, the use of custom system prompts, and the strategy for maintaining historical information in multi-turn conversations.

Plugin features include: code comments, unit testing, code explanation, code translation, candidate questions, code fixing, code review, and file Q&A.

You can use the CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B-128k model and control memory requirements by setting different `max_length` values. For example, you can set `max_length` to 16k or 32k to run the model on consumer-grade graphics cards.

Write a Quick sort in Python<|assistant|>
Quick Sort is a commonly used sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(nlogn). Below is an example of Quick Sort implemented in Python:
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

arr = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]
print(quick_sort(arr))
