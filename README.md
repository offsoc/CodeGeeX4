# CodeGeeX4: Open Multilingual Code Generation Model

We introduce CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B, the open-source version of the latest CodeGeeX4 model series. It is a multilingual code generation model continually trained on the [GLM-4-9B](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4), significantly enhancing its code generation capabilities. Using a single CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B model, it can support comprehensive functions such as code completion and generation, code interpreter, web search, function call, repository-level code Q&A, covering various scenarios of software development. CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B has achieved highly competitive performance  on public benchmarks, such as [BigCodeBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/bigcodebench) and [NaturalCodeBench](https://github.com/THUDM/NaturalCodeBench). It is currently the most powerful code generation model with less than 10B parameters, even surpassing much larger general-purpose models, achieving the best balance in terms of inference speed and model performance.

## Get Started

Use `4.39.0<=transformers<=4.40.2` to quickly launch [codegeex4-all-9b](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/codegeex4-all-9b)Ôºö

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/codegeex4-all-9b", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "THUDM/codegeex4-all-9b",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True
).to(device).eval()
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template([{"role": "user", "content": "write a quick sort"}], add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=True, return_tensors="pt", return_dict=True ).to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    outputs = outputs[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]
    print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Tutorials
CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B provides three user guides to help users quickly understand and use the model:

1. **[System Prompt Guideline](./guides/System_prompt_guideline.md)**: This guide introduces how to use system prompts in CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B, including the VSCode extension official system prompt, customized system prompts, and some tips for maintaining multi-turn dialogue history.

2. **[Infilling Guideline](./guides/Infilling_guideline.md)**: This guide explains the VSCode extension official infilling format, covering general infilling, cross-file infilling, and generating a new file in a repository.

3. **[repository Tasks Guideline](./guides/Repository_tasks_guideline.md)**: This guide demonstrates how to use repository tasks in CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B, including QA tasks at the repository level and how to trigger the aicommiter capability of CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B to perform deletions, additions, and changes to files at the repository level.

These guides aim to provide a comprehensive understanding and facilitate efficient use of the model.

## Evaluation

CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B is ranked as the most powerful model under 10 billion parameters, even surpassing general models several times its size, achieving the best balance between inference performance and model effectiveness.

CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B scored `48.9` and `40.4` for the `complete` and `instruct` tasks of BigCodeBench, which are the highest scores among models with less than 20 billion parameters.

In CRUXEval, a benchmark for testing code reasoning, understanding, and execution capabilities, CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B presented remarkable results with its COT (chain-of-thought) abilities. From easy code generation tasks in HumanEval and MBPP, to very challenging tasks in NaturalCodeBench, CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B also achieved outstanding performance at its scale. It is currently the only code model that supports Function Call capabilities and even achieves a better execution success rate than GPT-4.

Furthermore, in the "Code Needle In A Haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, the CodeGeeX4-ALL-9B model demonstrated its ability to retrieve code within contexts up to 128K, achieving a 100% retrieval accuracy in all python scripts.
